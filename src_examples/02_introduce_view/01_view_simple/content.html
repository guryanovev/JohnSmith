    This example demonstrates simple view rendering.
</p>

<p>
    Note that a View requires a template to render. Template is a selector that points to a hidden markup block.
    Usually such blocks defined with <code>script</code> element:
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;script id="TEMPLATE_ID" type="text/view"&gt;
    MARKUP GOES HERE
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
    Optionally a View could have an <code>init</code> method. It is a point where you can define bindings, nested views
    and so on. Note that you use <code>this.bind</code> instead of <code>js.bind</code> inside a view. This makes sure
    that all bindings are configured relatively to the View Context. It means that if you render view to <code>#myView</code> and
    bind to <code>.firstName</code> then actual binding will be setup to <code>#myVew .firstName</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Once View class is defined you can create a view instance by calling <code>js.createView</code> method.
    That method returns special View instance that could be rendered with <code>renderTo</code> method.
</p>
